# Amazon Clone

A Clone version of the Amazon web page was created to enhance my proficiency in HTML5,CSS3,JavaScript and jQuery. The original web page is feature-rich and follows a fixed-width design approach. It incorporates sliding and scrolling animations to enhance its visual appeal.  The same features were included in the designed web page clone. However, it's important to note that the web clone site is not responsive for small windows like mobile displays.
