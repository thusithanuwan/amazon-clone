# Amazon Clone

The Amazon Clone project is a web application that replicates the famous Amazon webpage. It was created with the goal of enhancing proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. The original Amazon webpage features sliding and scrolling animations to enhance its visual appeal, and these same features have been included in the designed web page clone. However, please note that the web clone site is not responsive for small windows like mobile displays.
